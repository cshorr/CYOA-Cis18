Only one ship remains, a ragged crew scrambling across its deck while a large man bellows orders.\n\nShops along the waterfront are hastily boarded, doors braced with mismatched scraps — splintered fence posts, broken crates, even pieces of furniture torn apart in a rush. The air feels tight with panic.\n\nPeople hurry through the streets with carts, baskets, and bags heaped with food and valuables. Some push wheelbarrows piled high; others clutch bundles over their shoulders.They all seem to be heading in the same direction as they head for the small foothills in the distance, cautious eyes dart constantly toward the sea.\n\nYou stop and mutter, “What the hell is going on?”",
