It's a small town, but its heart beats with the ambition of adventurers—a haven for those seeking fame, fortune, or just a little excitement. The main street is a jumble of humble homes and shops, all leading toward the grand stone building that houses the Adventurer's Guild.\nAs you step inside, the low murmur of conversations and the clinking of tankards fill the air. A stocky, cheerful woman with a weathered face smiles from behind a large wooden counter. \"Here to see the quest board?\" she asks, her voice a warm rasp. Before you can answer, she calls out to a figure sitting in the corner. \"Hey, Olly! Got a new one for you!\"\n\nA young man with wide, bright eyes and a disarming smile stands up, adjusts the leather pack on his back, and ambles over to you. \"This is Olly, your newly assigned guide. He seems to know everyone and everything, a living encyclopedia of the surrounding lands.\"",

It’s a massive, scarred slab of oak, so old that the grain has become a relief map of countless nail holes and rips. It's a collage of faded ink and fresh parchment, each tacked on with a mix of care and haste.\n\nThe top of the board is a mess of high-level requests, most of them marked with a blood-red DANGER stamp. Here, you see a notice from the dwarven mining community of Stonefall, offering a king's ransom for anyone brave enough to clear a dragon's nest from the Obsidian Peaks. The paper is torn and scorched at the edges. Next to it, a beautifully calligraphed letter from a noble house requests the retrieval of a stolen artifact from an ancient elven ruin, with the promise of land and title. The reward is immense, but the ink is fading from years of being unfulfilled.\n\nBelow these daunting tasks, the middle of the board is a mix of MEDIUM difficulty quests. A handful of towns are looking for help with bandit problems, their leaders' faces crudely drawn on a wanted poster. A farmer offers a simple reward of gold for the extermination of a giant spider infestation in his cellar. A frantic note from a traveling merchant asks for an escort through the Whispering Woods, a place known for its mischievous pixies and treacherous ground. These quests are for more advanced adventurers.",
